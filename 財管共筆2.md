## CH6 Valuing Bonds
### The Bond Market
- Bond p168
    - Security that obligates the issuer to make specifiedpayments to the bondholder
- Face Value (Par Value or Principal Value) 面值
    - Payment at the maturity of the bond
    - 歐美1000；台灣NTD10萬元
- coupon 票面利息
    - The interest payments made to the bondholder
- Coupon Rate 票面利率 p173
    - Annual interest payment, as a percentage of face value
- Table/Fig 6.1 Bid-Asked Price![](https://i.imgur.com/pabheIP.png)
    - Discount bond 折價債券 < 100% Coupon rate < YTM p175,9
    - Premium bond 溢價債券 > 100% Coupon rate > YTM p175,179
    - Par bond 平價債券 Coupon rate = YTM p172


### ++Interest Rates++ and ++Bond Price++
- Example 
    - What is the price of a 2.25 % annual coupon bond, with a $1,000 face value, which matures in 3 years? Assume a required return of 2.391%. p170
        - PV = 22.50/(1.02391) + 22.50/(1.02391)^2^ + 1022.50/(1.02391)^3^ = 995.96
        - PV(2.391%,3,22.5,1000)
        - Bond prices are quoted as a percentage of par 
        - Par Value × Pride % = $ Price p168 $1,000 x Price%=$995.96 Price% = 99.596 %
- Example 6.2(continued)p173
    - What is the price of the bond if the required rate of return is 1%(更改)？
        - PV=22.5 * PVIFA(1%,3)+1000 * PVIF(1%,3)
          Price% = 103.676%
        - Premium bond 溢價債券 coupon rate>YTM p175,179
- The value of the 2.25% bond falls as interest rates rise p173![](https://i.imgur.com/qa5R58E.png)
    - PV=807.27
- Different maturity bonds have different interest rate risk p174 Def.![](https://i.imgur.com/xMf0Vnj.png)
    - 對利率變動較敏感：綠線
    - 長期債券對利率變動較敏感，影響越久（折現約多次）
    - 價格跟利率是負向關係
The price of long-term bonds is more sensitive to changes in the
interest rate than is the price of short-term bonds.
- Interest Rate Risk 利率風險
    - The risk in bond prices due to fluctuations in interest rates.
- Practice
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/K9jZ6Ad.png)
        - a. 8%*1000
        - b. PV = 80 * PVIFA（7%,9）+ 1000 * PVIF（7%，9）
                = 80 * 6.5152 + 1000 * 0.5439 = 1065.116 
        - c. PV = 80 * PVIFA（6%,9) + 1000 * PVIF(6%,9)
                = 80 * 6.8017 + 1000 * 0.5919 = 1136.036
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/O2tJqW4.png)
        - sell at face value
        - 平價債券 ytm = 5%
        - a. PV = 50 * PVIFA(10%,3)+1000 * PVIF(10%,3) = 875.66
        - b. PV=50 * PVIFA(10%,10)+1000 * PVIF(10%,10)=692.77
        - c. Long-term bonds are more sensitive to a change in interest rates.
### ++Yield to Maturity++
- Bond Yield
    - Current yield 當期收益率
        - Annual coupon payments divided by bond price
    - Yield To Maturity 到期收益率
    - Example 
        - The market price of the bond is $1,200. What is the YTM of a 10.0% annual coupon bond, with a $1,000 face value, which matures in 3 years? What is the current yield? p175
            - PV = $1200 = $\frac{100}{(1+r)^1}$+$\frac{100}{(1+r)^2}$+$\frac{1100}{(1+r)^3}$
            - = Rate(3,100,-1200,1000)
            - = YIELD(Ref p178)
            - r = YTM = 2.94%
            - Current yield = 100/$1200 = 0.083 or 8.3%
            - Premium bond -> 
                - Coupon rate > current yield > YTM
                        10%       >       8.3%    > 2.94%
    - Practice
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/O8LXgM2.png)
            - a. $\frac{60}{1000}$ = 6% (無影響)
            - b. P 下降
            - c. YTM 上升
            - d. Current yield = $\frac{60}{P}$, p下降,Current yield上升
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Uvc6hqn.png)
            - a. Current yield = 80 / p = 6%
                p = 1333.33
            - b. YTM < 8%
                premium bond
### Bond ++Rates of Returns++
- Rate of Return(ROR)p177
    - Total income per period per dollar invested
    - Rate of return = $\frac{total\ income}{investment}$
    - Rate of return = $\frac{coupon\ income + price\ change}{investment}$
- Example 6.3
    - A bond increases in price from $963.80 (96.38%,YTM=4.60%) to $1,380.50 (138.05%, YTM=2.5%)and pays a coupon of $21.875 during the sameperiod. What is the rate of return?
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Wat2UXT.png)
    - Rate of return
    - (21.875 + (1380.50 - 963.80)) / 963.8
    - = 0.455
- Self-Test 6.6![](https://i.imgur.com/XA6m5ru.png)
    - $P_0$=1324.4
    - $P_1$=80 * PVIFA(6%,9) + 1000 * PVIF(6%,.9)=1136.04
    - YTM變大 4%->6% P1下降,ROR < YTM
    - ROR=$\frac{80+ (1136.04-1324.4)}{1324.4}$=$\frac{80-188.36}{1324.4}$=-8.18%
- Self-Test 6.7![](https://i.imgur.com/EsPIT6w.png)
    - $P_0$=1036.67
    - $P_1$=(80+1000) / 1.06 = 1018.87
    - YTM 6% 不變 ROR = YTM
    - ROR = (80 + (1018.87 - 1036.67)) / 1036.67 = 6%
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0MG7IGX.png)
- Practice
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/VyGU5p8.png)
        - YTM上升，ROR下降 （ROR < YTM）
        - $PV_0$=40 * PVIFA(7%,30)+1000 * PVIF(7%,30)
               =627.76(627.73,text,excel)
        - $PV_1$=40 * PVIFA(8%,29) + 1000 * PVIF(8%,29) 利率不同，期數減一
               =40*11.1584+1000*0.1073 = 553.64
        - ROR = $\frac{40+(553.64-627.73)}{627.73}$=-5.43%
### The Yield Curve
- Term Structure of Interest Rates
    - A listing of bond maturity dates and the interest rates that correspond with each date
    - 利率期間結構+strips
- Yield Curve 收益率曲線 p180
    - Plot of relationship between bond yields to maturity and time to maturitys
- Treasury strips are bonds that make a single payment. The yields on Treasury strips in November 2015 show thatinvestors received a higher yield on longer term bonds.![](https://i.imgur.com/gkRjBGY.png)
- Nominal and Real Rates of Interest
    - In the presence of inflation, an investor's realinterest rate is always less than the nominal interest rate p181(+CH5)
        - 1+real rate = $\frac{1+nominal\ rate}{1+inflation\ rate}$
    - EX. If youinvest in a security that pays 8% interest annually and inflation is 4%, what is your real interest rate?
        - 1 + real rate = 1.08 / 1.04
        - Real interest rate =.0385 or 3.85%
- Default Risk p183
    - Default or Credit Risk 違約風險（信用風險）
        - The risk that a bond issuer may default on its bonds
    - Default prernium 違約貼水、違約溢酬
        - The additional vield on a bond that investors require for bearing credit risk

        - $V_0=\frac{Div_1+P_1}{1+r}=\frac{3+81}{1.12}$=$$75$
    - Expected Return(類似第六章ROR)
        - $R=\frac{Div_1+P_1-P_0}{P_0} = Dividend Yield + Capital Gain(growth rate)$
        - $R=\frac{3 + 81 - 75}{75}=\frac{3}{75} + \frac{81-75}{75}=0.12$

### Simplifying the Dividend Discount Model
- three cases
    - No growth ->$g=0$->perpetuity p209
        - If we forecast no growth, and plan to hold out stock indefinitely, we will then value the stock as a ++PERPETUITY++(視為永續年金)
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/e0VKbgq.png =300x)![](https://i.imgur.com/O2ZKEZx.png =60x)(Assumes all earnings are paid to shareholders)
        - ++self-test 7.4++:Moonshine Industries has produced a barrel per week for the past 20 years but cannot grow because of certain legal hazards. It earns $25 per share per year and pays it all out to stockholders. The stockholders have alternative, equivalent-risk ventures yielding 20% per year on average. How much is one share of Moonshine worth? Assume the company can keep going indefinitely.
            - $P_0=\frac{25}{0.2}=125$
    - Constant Growth ->$g\neq0$->Gordon Model
        - A version of the dividend growth model in which dividends grow at a constant rate (Gordon Growth Model) (p210 * note 8)

            - a. $27=\frac{1.64*1.03}{r-3\%}$ -> r=9.26%
            - b. $27=\frac{1.64*(1+g)}{10\%-g}$ -> g=3.74%
            - c. ROE $g=return on equity*plowback ratio$ -> $5\% = ROE*0.4$ -> ROE = 0.125
        - If a firm elects to pay a lower dividend, and reinvest the funds, the stock price may increase because future dividends may be higher
            - Sustainable Growth Rate p211
                - The firm's growth rate if it plows back a constant fraction of earnings, maintains a constant return on equity, and keeps its debt ratio constant
                - $g = sustainable growth rate = ROE*plowback ratio$

## CH13 The Weighted-Average Cost of Capital and Company Valuation
- Capital Structure(financing融資)p394
    - The mix of long-term debt and equity financing
- Capital budgeting (investment)
- Company Cost of Capital =WACC
    - Opportunity cost of capital for investment in the firm as a whole 投資要求最低成本
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
    - 加權平均資金成本 p399
    - The expected rate of return on a portfolio of all the firm's securities, adjusted for tax savings due to interest payments
### Geothermal's Cost of capital
- Geothermal Inc. has the following structure. Giventhat Geothermal pays 8% for debt and 14% for equity, what is the company cost of capital? p395
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iO5wnph.png)
- Profolio return =(0.3 * 8%)+(0.7 * 14%)=12.2%
- Interest is tax deductible.
    - Given a 21% tax rate, debt only costs us 6.32% (i.e 8% * 0.79).
- WACC = (0.3 * 6.32%) + (0.7 * 14%) = 11.7%
### The Weighted-Average Cost of Capital(WACC)
- 稅盾(Tax shield)
    - Income Statement CH3-P64
    - (EBIT-Interest expense)-Taxes=Net income
    - (EBIT-Interest expense)x(tax rate)=Taxes--＞繳稅
    - (EBIT-Interest expense) x (1-tax rate)=Net income
    - (14,681-983)×(1-37%)=8,630
    - =14,681 -983x1 -14,681×37% +983x37%
    - =14,681  -983  -5432       +364
    - =息前稅前淨利- 利息成本-（稅）＋稅盾
- WACC
    - $r_{assets}=\frac{total\ income}{value\ of\ investments}$ p397
    - $r_{assets}=\frac{(D * r_{debt}) + (E * r_{equity})}{V}$
    - $r_{assets}=(\frac{D}{V}*r_{debt})+(\frac{E}{V}*r_{equity})$
        - IMPORTANT! P398 E, D and V are all market values of equity, debt, and total firm value
    - Taxes are an important consideration in the company cost of capital because ==interest payments are deducted== from income before tax is calculated. p399
        - $After-tax cost of debt = (1 - tax rate) * pretax cost = (1 - T_a) *r_{debt}$
        - Weighted Average Cost of Capital = WACC
        - $WACC=(\frac{D}{V}*(1-T_c)*r_{debt})+(\frac{E}{V}*r_{equity})$
    - Three Steps to Calculating Cost of Capital
        1. Calculate the value of each security as aproportion of the firm's market value -> **weights**（債券算權重）
        2. Determine the required rate of return on each security(知道報酬率)
        3. Calculate a weighted average of the after-tax return on the debt and the return on the equity(考慮稅盾)
    - Weighted Average Cost of Capital with Preferred Stock

    - Practice
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/VISoKd3.png =400x)
            - debt:D/V= 20/80 = 0.250
            - Preferred:P/V = 10/80 = 0.125
            - Common:E/V= 50/80 = 0.625
            - WACC= [0.250 x 6% x (1 -0.21)] + [0.125 x 8%] + [0.625 x 12%]= 9.685%
### Interpreting the WACC
- The WACC is an appropriate discount rate only for a project that is a carbon copy of the firm's existing business p402
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2PUVMAs.png =400x)
- There are two costs of debt financing
    - The ==explicit cost== of debt is the rate of interest bondholders demand 外顯成本
        - 還利息與本金 -> 倒閉風險 顯現在票券上面
    - The ==implicit cost== is the required increase in return from equity 隱含成本
        - 股東會怕，要求報酬率增加
    - Corporate taxes complicate the analysis and may change our decision -> CH16
### Measuring Capital Structure
- In estimating WACC, use the market value of the securities p403
- Market Value of Bonds
    - PV of all coupons and par value discountedat the current YTM
- Market Value of Equity
    - Market price per share multiplied by the number of outstanding shares
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/B7SWkNd.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/YZXR03w.png)

- If the long term bonds pay an 8% coupon and mature in 12 years, what is their market value assuming a 9% YTM? p404
    - PV=$\frac{16}{1.09}+\frac{16}{1.09^2}+...+\frac{16}{1.09^{12}}=$$185.70
    - PV=16 * PVIFA(9%,12) + 200 * PVIF(9%,12)
- The stock price is $12 a share. The total market value of the stock is: p405
    - 100m * $12=$1,200m

### Estimating Expected Returns
- Bonds p405
    - $r_d$ = YTM  CH6
- Common Stock p406
    - CAPM $r_e = r_f + \beta(r_m + r_f)$  CH12
    - Dividend Discount Model Cost of Equity  CH7
        - Perpetuity Growth Model : $P_0 = \frac{Div_1}{r-g} = \frac{Div_0 * (1 + g)}{r - g}$
        - $r_e = \frac{Div_1}{P_0} + g$
- Expected Return on Preferred Stock p407
    - Price of preferred stock = $P_0 = \frac{Div}{r_(preferred)}$
    - Solve for $r_(preferred)$ : $r_p = \frac{Div}{P_0}$
- Practice
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/fGfiZCa.png)
        - Hint:剩19期、查表查不到通常會出在選擇題
        - $80 * PVIFA(YTM, 19) + $1,000 * PVIF(VTM, 19) = $1,050
        - VTM =$r_d$= 7.50%
        - 7.5% * (1-21%) = 5.93%
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/1EudPnb.png)
        - $P_0=\frac{Div}{r}$
        - $40=\frac{4}{r_p}$
        - $r_p=10\%$
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/x3oDFkA.png)
        - $P_0=\frac{Div_1}{r_e-g}=>60=\frac{5*(1+5\%)}{r_e-5\%}$
        - $r_e=13.75\%$
### ~~Valuing Entire Businesses~~
## CH8 Net Present Value and Other Investment Criteria
### Net Present Value 淨現值法(越大越好)
- Net Present Value p241
    - Present value of cash flows minus initial investments
    - ==NPV = PV − required investment==
- Opportunity Cost of Capital
    - Expected rate of return given up by investing in a project
    - $NPV=C_0+\frac{C_1}{(1+r)^1}+\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2}+...+\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$
- Valuing an Office Building(補)
    - step1：Forecast cash flows p240
        - Cost of building = $C_0 = 350,000$
        - Sale price in Year 1 = $C_1 = 400,000$
    - step2：Estimate opportunity cost of capital
        - If equally risky investments in the capital market offer a return of 7%, then Cost of capital = r = 7%
    - step3：Discount future cash flows
        - $PV = \frac{C_1}{(1 + r)} = \frac{400,000}{(1 + 0.07)} = 373,832$
    - step4：Go ahead if PV of payoff exceeds investment
        - NPV = $-350,000+373,832 = 23,832$
- Risk and Present Value
    - Higher risk projects require a higher rate of return
    - Higher required rates of return cause lower PVs
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/hZMOkBq.png)
- **Net Present Value Rule** p241
    - Managers increase shareholders' wealth by accepting all projects that are worth more than they cost
    - ==NPV>0==
- Example p242
    - You have the opportunity to purchase an office building ($375,000). You have a tenant lined up that will generate $25,000 per year in cash flows for three years. At the end of three years you anticipate selling the building for $450,000.How much would you be willing to pay for the building?Assume a 7% opportunity cost of capital.
    - $NPV=-375000+\frac{25000}{(1.07)^1}+\frac{25000}{(1.07)^2}+\frac{25000}{(1.07)^3}$
    - =57942
- Example 8.2 p244
    - Select one of the two following projects, based on highest NPV
    - Assume a 7% discount rate

    - Q1 ![](https://i.imgur.com/TwDdEtZ.png)
        (i=11%, not in the FVPV Table)
        - $NPV_{A11\%}$=48.2, $NPV_{B11\%}$=44.37, both>0, acceptA&B
    - Q2 ![](https://i.imgur.com/m1gxqTi.png)
        - $NPV_{A11\%}>NPV_{B11\%}$ Accept project A.
    - Q3 ![](https://i.imgur.com/zYyz6gw.png)
        - $NPV_A$ =-$200 + $80 x PVIFA(16%, 4)=23.85 
        - $NPV_B$ = -$200 + $100 x PVIFA(16%, 3)=24.59 Choose B
    - Q11![](https://i.imgur.com/tY3wZq2.png)
        - a. NPV=-2200+300xPVIFA(5%,15)-900xPVIF(5%,15)=481(m)
        - b. NPV=-2200+300xPVIFA(18%,15)-900xPVIF(18%,15)- 748 (m)
### The Internal Rate of Return Rule 內部報酬率(越大越好)
- Internal tRate of Return (IRR) p245
    - ==Discount rate at which NPV = 0==
    - 淨現值法的一個特例
- Rate of Return Rule P246
    - Invest in any project offering a rate of return that is higher than the opportunity cost of capital
    - Rate of return (ROR)= $\frac{C_1 - investment}{investment} = \frac{C_1-C_0}{C_0} = \frac{C_1}{C_0} - 1$
    - $1 + ROR = \frac{C_1}{C_0} -> C_0 * (1 + r) = C_1 -> C_0 = \frac{C_1}{(1 + r)}$
    - $NPV = -C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1 + IRR)} = 0$
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6ZD7OGv.png)
    - $NPV = -C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1 + IRR)} =  -350,000 + \frac{400,000}{(1 + IRR)} = 0$
    - Rate of return = $\frac{400,000 - 350,000}{350,000} = 0.1429 = 14.29\%$
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/C0g89g7.png)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/k94XlJo.png)
    - $NPV = -375,000 + \frac{25,000}{(1 + IRR)^1} + \frac{25,000}{(1 + IRR)^2} + \frac{475,000}{(1 + IRR)^3} = 0$
    - $IRR = 12.56\%$ (trial and error)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/V1mZcL0.png)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/VS2u3Y2.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/I0DCspg.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/p4ydpXw.png)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/JrTZUhT.png)
    - $NPV_A = 0$
    - $= -30000 + \frac{21000}{(1 + IRR)^1} + \frac{21000}{(1 + IRR)^2}$
    - $= -30000 + 21000 * PVIFA(IRR, 2)$
    - IRR(A) = 25.69%
    - IRR(B) = 20.69%
    - Choose project A by IRR, B is preferred by NPV.(以NPV為準測，選B)
#### Pitfall
- Pitfall 1 - Mutually Exclusive Projects P249
    -  Projects that earn a good rate of return for a long time often have higher NPVs than those that offer high percentage rates of return but die young. 
- Pitfall 2 - Lending or Borrowing ? P251
    - With some cash, the NPV of the project increases as the discount rate increases
    - This is contrary to the normal relationship between PV and discount rates
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/o4dwCmJ.png)
    -  借錢準則相反   
- Pitfall 3 - Multiple Rates of Return P252
    - There can be as many different IRRs as there are changes in the sign of the cash-flow stream.
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/swojemY.png)
- Q20![](https://i.imgur.com/UHpfISy.png)
    - $NPV = 5000 + \frac{4000}{(1 + 12\%)^1} - \frac{11000}{(1 + 12\%)^2}$
    - NPV(12%) = -197.7 < 0 -> Reject it.
    - Because CF ++\-(borrowing圖形), higher IRR means should return more $.
### The Profitability Index 獲利指數(越大越好)
- Prifitability Index
    - Ratio of net present value to initial investment
    - Profitability index = $\frac{NPV}{initial\ investment} = \frac{（收入-成本）的現值}{C_0}$
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/luvBgYI.png)
- Capital Rationing P254資本限額
    - Limit set on the amount of funds available for investment
    - Soft Rationing
        - Limits on available funds imposed by management
    - Hard Rationing
        - Limits on available funds imposed by the unavailability of funs in the capital market
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/oXyIxqM.png)
        - $NPV(A) = -3 + \frac{1}{(1.1)^1} + \frac{1}{(1.1)^2} + ... + \frac{1}{(1.1)^5} = -3 + 1 * PVIFA(10\%,5)$
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/BhXXWLO.png)
        - a. C, E
        - b. NPV > 0, choose all.
### The Payback Rule 還本期間(越小越好)
- Payback Period P255
    - Time until cash flows recover the initial investment of the project
- The payback rule specifies that a project be accepted if its payback period is less than a specified cutoff period
    - The following example will demonstrate a major problem with this statement
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Jxt2HC.png)
