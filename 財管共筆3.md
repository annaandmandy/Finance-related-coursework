## CH11 Introduction to Risk, Return, and the Opportunity Cost of Capital
### Rates of Return : A Review
- Percentage return = $\frac{capital\ gain + divident}{initial\ share\ price}$
- Divident yield = $\frac{divident}{initial\ share price}$
- Capital gain yield = $\frac{capital\ gain}{initial\ share\ price}$
- 1 + real rate of return = $\frac{1 + nominal\ rate\ of\ return}{1 + inflation\ rate}$
- Practice
    - Q7![](https://i.imgur.com/pW7wHwp.png)
        - a. $\frac{(44-40)+2}{40} = 15\%$
        - b. $\frac{2}{40} = 5\%$  $\frac{4}{40} = 10\%$
        - c. $\frac{2}{40} = 5\%$  $\frac{36-40}{40} = -10\%$
    - Q8![](https://i.imgur.com/B0ksi1Z.png)
        - a. $\frac{(42-40)+2}{40} = 10\%$
        - b. 1+10% = (1 + r) * 1.04 -> r=5.77%
### A Century of Capital Market History
- Market Index
    - Measure of the investment performance of the overall market
- Dow Jones Industrial Average(The Dow)
    - Index of the investment performance of a portfolio of 30 "blue-chip" stocks (藍籌股、績優股)
- Standard & Poor's Composite Index(S&P 500)
    - Index of the investment performance of the portfolio of 500 large stocks

- Maturity Premium 期間貼水、到期風險溢酬 P336
    - Extra average return from investing in long-versus short-term Treasury securities,
    - Maturity Premium = 5.3% - 3.8% = 1.5%
- Risk Premium 風險貼水、風險報酬 P337
    - Expected return in excess of risk-free return as compensation for risk
    - Risk Premium = 11.5% - 3.8% = 7.7%

- Variance 變異數 P341
    - Average value of squared deviations from mean
    - A measure of volatility
- Standard Deviation 標準差
    - Squared root of variance
    - Another measure of volatility
- Coin-toss game; calculating variance and standard deviation

- Q14![](https://i.imgur.com/ro1zYfN.png)
    -  $E(R_i) = r = 0.5 * (-18) + 0.5 * 26 = 4\%$
    -  $\sigma^2 = 0.5 * (-18-4)^2 + 0.5*(26-4)^2 = 484(\%^2)$
    -  $\sigma = \sqrt{484(\%^2)} = 22(\%)$
- Q15![](https://i.imgur.com/dE7rpPx.png)
    - $R_{boom} = (240-80+8)/80 = 210(\%)$
    - $R_{normal} = (90-80+4)/80 = 17.5(\%)$
    - $R_{recession} = (0-80+0)/80 = -100(\%)$
    - $E(R_i) = 1/3 * (210 + 17.5 - 100) = 42.5(\%)$
    - $\sigma^2 = 1/3[(210 - 42.5)^2 + (17.5 - 42.5)^2 + (-100 - 42.5)^2]$
    - $\sigma = \sqrt{16327(\%^2)} = 127.28(\%)$

### Risk and Diversification
- Diversification 多角化 P345
    - Strategy designed to reduce risk by spreading the portfolio across many investments
- Specific Risk 
    - 公司特有、可分散、非系統風險 P353
    - Risk factors affecting only that firm, also calle "diversifiable risk"
    - 王永慶、張榮發、Jobs、嚴凱泰
- Market Risk
    - 市場、不可分散、系統風險
    - Economy-wide sources of risk that affect the overall stock market, also called "systematic risk"
    - 金融風暴、virus

### Thinking about Risk
- Message 1
    - Some risks look big and dangerous but really are diversifiable
- Message 2
    - Market risks are macro risks (整體現象)
        - Airlines, Machine tool manufactures 易受景氣影響
        - Food companies, Electric utilities 不受景氣影響
- Message 3
    - Risk can be measured 
## CH12 Risk, return and Capital Budgeting
### 12.1 Measuring ==Market Risk==
- Market Portfolio 市場投資組合 p364 (如何衡量市場報酬？)
    - **Portfolio** of all assets in the economy
    - In practice a broad stock **market index** is used to represent the market
- Beta ($\beta$)
    - Sentitivity of a stock's return to the return on the market portfolio
    - $\beta=\frac{\delta R_i}{\delta R_m}$($\delta R_i$=個別股票變動值，$\delta R_m$=市場變動值)
        - $\beta>1$：Aggressive stocks 攻擊性
        - $\beta<1$：Defensive stocks 防禦性(保守)
        - $\beta=1$：The average beta of all stocks
        - $\beta=0$：Risk free asset p373
- Example

### 12.2 What Can You Learn from ==Beta==?($\beta$)p368
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/40uvpg3.jpg =500x)
    - 每個公司的Beta值不一樣(受到的市場經濟風險不同)
- Diversification decreases variability from unique risk, but not from market risk
- The beta of your portfolio will be an average of the betas of the securities in the portfolio p369
- Portfolio beta
    - (fraction of portfolio in stock 1 x beta of stock 1) + (fraction of portfolio in stock 2 x beta of stock 2)
- If you owned all of the S&P Composite Index stocks, you would have an average beta of 1.0 P373
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jf3ggMT.png =600x)
    - a.退休基金比較保守
    - b.跟S&P波動幾乎一樣(=1)
- a full (well)diversified portfolio->$\rho=1$ p372
    - $\beta=\rho*\frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}$($=\frac{cov}{\sigma^2_m}$)
    - $\sigma_i*\rho=\beta_i*\sigma_m$
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/3JYjO75.png =460x)
### 12.3 Risk and Return
- Market Risk Premium p373
    - Difference betwen market return and return on risk-free Treasury bills
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/MG0EWE5.png =500x)
        - $r_i=r_f+slope*\beta$
        - $slope=\frac{r_m-r_f}{1-0}$(x軸變化對y軸的影響)
        - 兩點決定直線方程式 $(r_i,\beta),(r_m, 1), (r_f, 0)$
            - $\frac{r_i-r_f}{\beta - 1} = \frac{r_m - r_f}{1-0}$
            - $r_i - r_f = (r_m - r_f)*\beta$
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/hl4wR3L.png =500x)
        - $r_i=3％+slope*\beta$
        - $slope=\frac{10％-3％}{1-0}=7％$
        - $r_i=3％+7％*\beta$ (高風險高報酬)
- $r_m-r_f$
- Risk Premium:
    - 風險貼水
    - 風險溢酬(CH11)
- $r_i-r_f$
- CAPM-Capital Asset Pricing Model
    - 資本資產定價模式 p374
    - Theory of the relationship between risk and return which states that the expected risk premium on any security equals its beta times the market risk premium.
        - Market risk premium = $r_m-r_f$
        - Risk premium on any asset = $r-r_f$ (CH11 p337)
        - Expected return  = $r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)$ (12.2)
        - CAPM ： ==$r=r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)$==
- Example:
    - The return on the stock market is 10% and the risk free rate of return is 3%. What is the risk premium for a stock that has a beta of 0.5? What is the expected return of the stock?
        - $r_m=10％$
        - $r_f=3％$
        - $\beta = 0.5$
        - Market risk premium = $r_m-r_f=10％-3％=7％$
        - risk premium on asset = $r-r_f = \beta(r_m-r_f)=0.5*7％$
        - Expect return  $r=r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)=3％+3.5％=6.5％$
- Practice
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/EsuWnSG.png =600x)
        -  $r=r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)=4％+0.75*7％＝9.25％$
        -  $P_0=\frac{P_1+D_1}{1+r}->50=\frac{P_1+2}{1.0925}->P_1=＄52.625$
        -  另解：$r=\frac{P_1-P_0+D_1}{P_0}$
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/o7OTrEN.png)
        - $r=r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)$
        - stock A：$5=r_f+0.5(r_m-r_f)$
        - stock B：$13=r_f+1.5(r_m-r_f)$
        - 百分比省略計算
        - $r_f = 1\%, r_m = 9\%, r_m-r_f = 8\%$
- SML (Security Market Line) P376
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3iaN2HK.png =560x)
    - SML equation = ==$r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)$== (即CAPM公式在線上)

- Capital Budgeting and Project Risk
    - Project cost of capital p380
        - Minimum acceptable expected rate of return on a project given its risk
        - The project cost of capital depends on the use to which the capital is being put
        - Therefore, it depends on the risk of the project and not the risk of the company
    - Company cost of capital p382
        - Opportunity cost of capital for investment in the firm as a whole
        - The company cost of capital is the appropriate discount rate for an average-risk investment project undertaken by the firm
- Equations
    - $\beta_i=\frac{\delta R_i}{\delta R_m}=\rho*\frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}$
    - $\sigma_i*\rho=\beta_i*\sigma_m$
    - CAPM
        - $r=r_f+\beta(r_m-r_f)$
        - $\beta = \frac{r_i-r_f}{r_m-r_f}$
### CH12補充
- 公式推導 $\sigma_i*\rho=\beta_i*\sigma_m$
    - $\beta_i=\frac{\delta R_i}{\delta R_m}=\rho*\frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}$
    - 簡單線性回歸
    - 利用最小平方法找出$\beta,\sigma,\rho$
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/TUmiPSI.png =400x)
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/NTomJkd.png =400x)
- $\beta值介紹$
    - 理論上$\beta$值>0
        - 當大盤在上漲時，個別股應該也會跟著漲，只是漲多漲少，頂多不漲
    - 若是$\beta$值<0
        - 可能這支股票曾經發生過某些特殊的事
        - 若要長期逆勢，跟大盤背道而馳，這不合理

## CH14 Introduction to Corporate Financing
### Creating Value with Financing Decisions
>Competition in financial markets is fierce -- much more so than in product markets
1. Few protected niches(利基) (ex:cannot patent(專利) the structure of a new security)
2. Securities sell for their **true values**(ch7)
    - efficient market theory
    - hard to get abnormal return(free lunches)
### Patterns of Corporate Financing
- Sources of Funds/Debt Ratio
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/IuDhjso.png =500x)
    - 負的:買回庫藏股
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7xrxobu.png =500x)
    - $\frac{D}{D + E}$ : 紅色線的E較大, market value > book value
- What happens when the firm cannot finance all of its activities from plowed-back funds?(保留盈餘)
    - Financial Deficit 財務赤字
        - Different between the cash companies need and the amount generated internally.
    - Sell new equity or borrow. (沒錢才借,或為了取得信用才借)
    - Over the 27-year period, internal funds covered 96% of corporate capital requirements.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/LIODMfV.png =500x)
    - Debt to (Debt + Equity) Ratio for Non-Financial Firms
### Common Stock
- Treasury Stock 庫藏股 51m
    - Stock that has been repurchased by the company and held in its treasury
- Issued Shares 發行股份 318m
    - Shares that have been issued by the company
- Outstanding Shares 流通在外股分 267m
    - Shares that have been issued by the company and held by investors
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6s5haBI.png =600x)
    - 800m = 318m + 482m
    - $1 / 0.1 = 10股
    - Par value 面額(帳面) + Additional Paid in capital = 股價 (超過面額發行=溢價發行)
- Book Value vs. Market Value
    - Book value is a backward looking measure記錄下來不會變
        - Tells us how much capital the firm has raised from shareholders in the past
        - Does not measure the value that shareholders place on those shares today
    -  BV per share = $18,894m/267m = $70.76
    -  The market value of the firm is forward looking
        -  Depends on the future dividents that shareholders expect to receive
    - MV per share = $250
- Example - FedEx

    - 只要有發行債券 -> 產生稅盾 -> 投資者拿到的比較多(ch16)
### Preferred Stock
- Preferred stock (Hybrid)：混合股票(無到期日)&債券(配息固定)的特色 p429
    - Stock that takes priority over common stock in regards to dividents 提早發股利
    - Advantages:dividents, Tax Advantages(稅制優惠 ex:只收50%稅)
    - Potential Disadvantages:Interest rate flutuations
- Net worth
    - Book value of common shareholder's equity plus preferred stock
- Floating-rate preferred
    - Preferred stock paying dividends that vary with short term interest rates 特別股發放的股息會跟利率一起變動
- Corporate debt p430
    - Debt has the unique feature of allowing the borrowers to walk away from their obligation to pay, in exchange for the assets of company
    - "Default Risk" is the term used to describe the likelihood that a firm will walk away from its obligation
    - "Bond Ratings" are issued on debt instruments to help investors assess the default risk of a firm
- Callable bond 可贖回債券 (買債券的權力)p431
    - Bond that may be repurchased by firm beform maturity at specified call price
    - Price of callable bond vs. straight bond
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/AvjkUgF.png =550x)
        - 藍線(straight bond)：YTM增加 -> $P_0$下跌 -> 負斜率
        - 橘線(callable bond)：利率往下掉的時候公司把債券贖回，再重新發行低利率(coupon rate)的債券，公司借錢的成本會降低
    - v.s. Putable bond 可賣回債券
        - 當利率要往上走時，債券價格會下跌，投資者要用較低的價格才能賣出債券(投資者會不喜歡買)
        - 用putable bond 讓投資者可以賣回公司，讓投資者不會賣太低價
- Eurodollars 歐洲美元 p432
    - Dollars held on deposit in a bank outside the USA
- Eurobond 歐洲美元債券
    - Bond denominated in a currency not of the country in which it is issued
### Convertible Securities
- Warrant 認股權證 p435
    - Right to buy shares from a company at a stipulated price(特定價格) before a set date
- Convertible Bond 可轉換債券
    - Bond that the holder may exchange for as specified amount of another security

    - The mix of long-term debt and equity financing
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3YKH5EN.png)
- Modigliani and Miller (MM)p469
    - When there are ==no taxes== and ==capital markets function well==, the market value of a company does not depend on its capital structure
    - In other words, financial managers cannot increase value by changing the mix securities used to finance the company
- ==MM I== ：Under idealized conditions the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure 公司的價值不會受到他的資本結構影響(資本結構無關論)p472
- Assumptions p469

    - equity承擔風險大
- Operating Risk(business risk)
    - Risk in the firm's operating income
- Financial Risk
    - Risk to shareholders resulting from the use of debt
- Financial Leverage(財務槓桿)
    - Debt financing to amplify(放大) the effects of changes in operating income on the returns to stockholders
- Interest Tax Shield
    - Tax savings resulting from deductibility of interest payments
- Under "normal" situation
    - Debt financing **does not** you affect the operating risk of the firm.
        - Operating Income in Table 16.2 = Table 16.3
    - Debt financing does add the financial risk.
        - EPS in Table 16.2 < Table 16.3     (12.5% < 15%)
    - Financial Leverage(Table on p474) 財務槓桿
        - D up (under "Normal" situation)
        - Shareholder value(share price) unchanged
        - $E(r_i)$ up (offset) Financial riask up
### Debt and the Cost of Equity(MM II)
- $WACC = (1 - T_c)r_{debt}(\frac{D}{D+E}) + r_{equity}(\frac{E}{D+E})$
- $WACC = r_{asset} = r_{debt}(\frac{D}{V}) + r_{equity}(\frac{E}{V})$
- $r_{equity} = r_{asset} + \frac{D}{E}(r_{assets}-r_{debt})$
- ==MMII=== the required rate of return on equity increses as the firm's debt-equity ratio increases
- EX 16.1 p475
    - 100% equity-financed:
        - $r_{equity} = r_{assets} = \frac{125,000}{1,000,000} = 12.5\%$
    - 50% equity, 50% debt-financed:
        - $r_{equity} = r_{assets} + \frac{D}{E}(r_{assets} - r_{debt})$
        - $= 0.125 + \frac{500,000}{500,000}(0.125-0.1) = 15\%$
        - $WACC = r_{assets} = 12.5\% = 0.5*10\% + 0.5*r_E$

    - Expected return on assets is:
        - $r_{assets} = (8\%*\frac{30}{100}) + (16\%*\frac{70}{100}) = 13.6\%$
    - The new return on equity is:
        - $r_{equity} = r_{assets} +[\frac{D}{E}*(r_{assets}-r_{debt})]$
        - $=13.6\% + [\frac{20}{80}*(13.6\%-8\%)] = 15\%$
        - $WACC = r_{assets} 不動(資本結構無關論)= 13.6\% = \frac{20}{100} * 8\% = \frac{80}{100} * r_E$

### Debt, Taxes, and the WACC ==資本結構有關論==
- River Cruise ==DOES== create value in a corporate tax environment by using debt financing. This is done by maximizing the cash flows to both equity and bondholders.

- PV of tax shield = $\frac{D*r_D*T_c}{r_D} = D * T_C$  p479(assume perpetuity)
    - Example: Tax benefit = 500,000*0.1*0.21 = $10,500
    - PV of $10,500 perpetuity = $\frac{10500}{0.1}$
    - = 500,000*0.21 = 105,000(note 6,7)

    - Q21 After a grace period of 5 years
        - a. PV tax shield = 0.21 * debt = 0.21*$40 = &8.4
        - $WACC = 12.83\% = [\frac{40}{160}*8\%*(1-21\%)] + [\frac{120}{160}*15\%]$
        - c. Annual tax shield = 0.21 \* interest expense = 0.21 * (0.08*$40) = $0.67
        - PV tax shield = $0.67 * ( $\frac{1}{1.08} + \frac{1}{1.08^2} +\frac{1}{1.08^3} + \frac{1}{1.08^4} + \frac{1}{1.08^5}$)
        - =$0.67 * PVIFA(8%,5) = $2.68
        - The total value of the firm falls by $8.4 = $2.68 = $5.72
        - The total value of the firm = $160.00-$5.72 = $154.28
